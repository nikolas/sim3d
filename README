###############################

For my final project, I modified the simulator I made for Theme 3 Milestone 1 to
work in three dimensions. The modifications I made are:

* 3D gravitational, spring, simplegravity, lineardrag and vortex forces
* 3D rendering provided by OpenGL
* A interactive 3D camera controls
  - Uses a "crystal ball" interface, where the camera is always looking at the
    origin, and the user can move around the origin, as well as towards or away
    from the origin.
  - While running the simulator, use the arrow keys to rotate the camera around
    the origin. Use - and = to move away from or towards the center.
* 3D semi-implicit and symplectic integrators. Note that a linearized implicit
  integrator is also provided, but does not work with spring forces, as the
  spring force Hessian in 3D is not implemented.
* Added an XML attribute to the scene parser which sets the camera's location in
  spherical coordinates:
    <camera r="[ ]" theta="[ ]" phi="[ ]" />
* Created 14 sample scenes, provided in the assets/3d directory of this
  submission.
